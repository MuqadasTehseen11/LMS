I have developed a sophisticated Library Management System using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. This system features three dashboards: Admin Dashboard, User Dashboard, and Registration. The backend is powered by PHP with data stored in a library system database in phpMyAdmin. The Admin Dashboard allows secure login for admins to manage books, categories, authors, and issue books. The User Dashboard enables registered students to log in, browse available books, and view issued books. The Registration Dashboard allows new students to register and gain access. Enhancements include a modern, responsive UI using CSS frameworks, advanced password hashing for security, SQL injection prevention, email notifications for key actions, search functionality, and pagination for efficient data handling. This project demonstrates my full-stack development skills, emphasizing secure, efficient, and user-friendly design. hashtag#FullStackDevelopment hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#PHP hashtag#HTML hashtag#CSS hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#LibraryManagementSystem hashtag#DatabaseManagement hashtag#SecureCoding hashtag#ResponsiveDesign
